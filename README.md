# Smooth pursuit test analysis

The smooth pursuit data analysis was done with Python programming. 
1.	Data pre-processing – This pre-processing step involves arranging the data into data-frames so I can carry out visualization and analysis in Python environment. All null values were also eliminated.
2.	Plots generation – 
Figure 1 and 2 shows the smooth pursuit stimuli. By plotting the pursuit position “Pdeg” and velocity V at each timepoint in “tlist”, the smooth pursuit stimuli show a symmetric path with peaks at 10 degrees for the position and 1 degree/sec for the velocity. The data is without noise as seen by the perfect sinewaves plotted.
